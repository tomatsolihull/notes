$\large{1234_{10}}$

1235 are the **digits**
10 is the **radix** (**base**)

- Higher bases (eg, base 16 hex) are used since they can represent a larger number in a smaller number of characters for humans to read.
- A computer only ever interprets [[binary]], so when it comes to computing, these systems are only used for convenience and are another way of displaying binary information.
