# Benefits

## Remote Shopping
- Allows the shopper to place orders when and where they choose.
- The ability to purchase necessities such as groceries, personal care and homewares allows housebound individuals to gain much-needed independence.

## Access to Goods
- Does not require a large storefront with products on display. Instead, products can be packed tightly in a warehouse allowing them to stock more products or a bigger variety of product.
- Many websites offer international shipping. This allows a large variety of regional or cultural items to be bought and sold across the world.
-  Less overhead than running a brick-and-mortar store, especially one that stocks the same quantity of goods. This allows an online store to charge more competitive prices for the same products.

## Added Value
- Discount and coupon codes can be given out and easily applied at checkout.
	- These could be given exclusively to those who are a member of an online loyalty scheme which incentives people to keep shopping in the same places repeatedly.
- Product reviews from other shoppers and detailed product information can provide a greater insight into a product and its capabilities than what would be available in a brick-and-mortar shop.
- Detailed wish lists, watch lists and other lists can be kept and organised to set aside items a shopper wishes to revisit.
- Limitless basket: a shopper can buy as much as they want without having to worry about needing to carry it home or how heavy it will be.
- Shop from wherever they want to, at any time.
	- No need to leave the house to place and receive an order.

# Drawbacks

## Payment Security
The retailer, the payment gateway and the delivery provider all need to be trusted with handling customer data and [[Personally Identifiable Information]]. Many people may be hesitant to give out their information to websites they are unfamiliar with.

## Actual Products
Not having the actual product available physically for a customer to try or use can increase the number of returns if the item is not what the customer expected. This adds overhead to the business and inconvenience for the customer.

## Reliance on Delivery Services

- Most e-commerce retailers do not use their own courier service, instead relying on existing providers such as DHL, UPS or the Royal Mail’s parcel arm: Parcelforce.
- This opens the door for potential unreliability. If a delivery is later than expected, the customer may blame the retailer before the delivery service, harming the business’ reputation.
- Deliveries could be disrupted or damaged for reasons outside of the control of the retailer, facilitating a return or an additional item being sent at the business’ expense.

## Impact on Employment
- E-Commerce websites themselves require less staff to operate, generally. One person could feasibly run a small online shop provided they had the know-how. This is significantly different to a brick-and-mortar store where even the smallest will usually require at least a few other staff members.
- With larger businesses, the types of employees differ across e-commerce businesses and in-person stores.
- Online stores require technical personnel to keep the website and infrastructure operational and the marketing will likely mostly be digital in nature. There are no shop-floor stockists or salespeople required, instead jobs are required in warehouse roles, organising, and managing orders and returns.

## Increased Social Divide
- Not everyone is able to access the internet, and not everyone is as comfortable with using technology as others.
	- This creates a social ‘divide’ between those that live-and-breathe e-commerce and those that are more wary or unable to access it.
	- This dishearteningly and disproportionally effects those who are more elderly and those who are disabled.

- Many people may simply just not be comfortable with giving their information over the internet and prefer shopping in person for this reason.
