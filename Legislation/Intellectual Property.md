## Copyright Design & Patents Act (1988)
Protects intellectual property, such as brand names, stories and designs.

There are different protections that can apply to works: copyright, patents, licensing, and trademarks.

### Copyright  
Copyright defines rights the creator has over their own work. It also applies to digital work, such as music, videos, code, etc. Does not need to be applied for â€“ it is automatically assumed when you create a piece of work. Copyright makes it illegal to copy work without permission; the owner can take legal action.

### Patents  
Patents give the inventor the right to decide if/how an invention can be used by others.

### Trademarks  
Trademarks cover brand names, logos and other "service marks.

## Licencing
Certain rights can be waived by applying a less restrictive license to a work. [[Open Source]] software often uses licenses that allow the reuse and redistribution of code.
