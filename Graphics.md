# Pixels
Most images on a computer are broken up into pixels (picture elements). The most basic form of image storage is referred to as ‘_pix-map_’ or ‘_bit-map_.’ This refers to the fact that the file is made up of a long list of 1s and 0s representing every pixel.

# Resolution
- With any digital raster graphics format, the higher the number of pixels, the higher quality the image will be. This is referred to as the ‘resolution’ of an image and is written as the number of pixels available horizontally and vertically.
- For example, an average desktop computer monitor may have the resolution of 1920×1080. This is 1920 pixels along the X-axis and 1080 on the Y-axis for a total of 2,073,600 pixels.
## Megapixels
- In digital photography, image sizes are expressed as megapixel values
- 1 megapixel is 1,000,000 pixels.
- A megapixel value is calculated by multiplying the width and the height together, so an image that is 640×480 is made up of 307,200 pixels or 0.3 megapixels.
- A high-end smartphone camera might be able to take 48-megapixel images whereas a lower quality webcam may only be able to capture 1-megapixel images.

# Colour
- Each pixel contains information about the colour it needs to represent. In a 1-bit image, each pixel is represented by a single bit. This means that a pixel can either be 1 or 0 and results in a monochrome image.  
- In an 8-bit image, each pixel is represented by 8 bits of colour information, making it possible to store 256 (28) unique colours. The number of bits used to store this information is the ‘bit depth’ or ‘colour depth’ of the image. Modern displays can display ‘true colour’ which refers to a 24-bit colour depth—a total of 16,777,216 colours.

# Storage
- Image data in a raster file is stored as long list of pixel data called a matrix.
-  To display the image, the computer needs to know how many bits make up a pixel, what format the colour information takes and the size of the image. This auxiliary information is called ‘metadata.’
- Bitmap graphic files can be uncompressed or employ either [[Lossy]] or [[Lossless]] [[Compression]] algorithms. _jpg_ files and _gif_ files are examples of lossy formats, while _png_ and _tiff_ can both be lossless.
