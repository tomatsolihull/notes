# Pixels
- Pixel = Picture Element
- Pix-map or Bit-map = long list of pixels, basic image storage method
# Resolution
- More pixels = more detail
- 1920×1080 = a total of 2,073,600 pixels.
## Megapixels
- Used in digital photograpgy
- 1 megapixel is 1,000,000 pixels.
- A megapixel value is calculated by multiplying the width and the height together, so an image that is 640×480 is made up of 307,200 pixels or 0.3 megapixels.

# Colour
- In a 1-bit image, each pixel is represented by a single bit. This means that a pixel can either be 1 or 0 and results in a monochrome image.  
- In an 8-bit image, each pixel is represented by 8 bits of colour information, making it possible to store 256 (28) unique colours.
- The number of bits used to store this information is the ‘bit depth’ or ‘colour depth’ of the image.
- Modern displays can display ‘true colour’ which refers to a 24-bit colour depth—a total of 16,777,216 colours.

# Storage
- Image data in a raster file is stored as long list of pixel data called a matrix.
- To display the image, the computer needs to know how many bits make up a pixel, what format the colour information takes and the size of the image. This auxiliary information is called ‘metadata.’
- Bitmap graphic files can be [[Lossy]] (jpg, gif) or [[Lossless]] (png, tiff).

# Vector
- Stored as mathematical instructions for drawing shapes
- Infinitely scalable up/down with no loss in quality
- Good for logos, fonts
- Bad for photographs, high detail
