The [Health & Safety Executive](https://hse.gov.uk) issues guidance and legislation covering many aspects, including what constitutes a safe working environment and how this can be achieved

H&S Legislation governs the responsibilities of both the employer and employees.

- Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 (aka HSW Act 1974)
- The Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999
- Electricity at Work Regulations 1989 ([[Health & Safety/Portable Appliance Testing]])

Every business with five or more employees must have a written policy which sets out how the business handles health and safety, who is responsible and what is expected of both the employer and the employee. This must be available to all employees.
