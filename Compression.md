A compression [[Algorithm]] is used to reduce the size of a file (the number of [[Binary#Bits]] required to represent it)

Use cases of compression include
- Allowing more data to be sent over a lower [[Bandwidth]] connection
- Take up less storage space

Depending on the type of compression used, the compression may be reversible or permanent.
