# Control Loops
## Open Loop
![[zk/attachments/loop open.svg]]
- Output has no bearing on the system
- Error needs to be accounted for by the user
	- Acquired knowledge
- Example: Space Heater - keeps running until switched off and cannot monitor output
- Less complicated, less cost

## Closed Loop

![[zk/attachments/loop closed.svg]]
- Output is fed fed back into the controller
- Able to correct for error
- More accurately able to achieve desired input
- Example: boiler/hvac that can turn on/modify process depending on room temperature and comparing it to input (desired temp)
- More complicated, more cost

Goes into a lot of detail but some of the simpler videos are very useful; the formulas not so much.
