# Carrier-Sense Multiple Access
A [[zk/MAC]] [[zk/Channel Access Method]] that controls the sending of data on a network with a shared transmission medium, such as one in a [[zk/Bus Topology]].
It means that a device will check for the absence of traffic before sending data itself.
A device will wait for an ongoing transmission to finish before it sends its data.
