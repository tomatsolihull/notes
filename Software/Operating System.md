An operating system provides the base upon which applications and programs run.  
For the user, it provides an interface â€“ a textual CLI ([[command line interface]]) or a GUI ([[graphical user interface]]).  
For developers, it provides APIs (programming interfaces) for common tasks shared amongst many programs, such as writing files and displaying graphics.

A computer is essentially inoperable without an operating system installed.

Examples of operating systems include:
- [[Software/Windows]]
- [[Software/Linux]]
- [[Software/macOS]]
