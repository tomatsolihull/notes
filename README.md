# Notes

> ⚠️  
  In the end, I did not end up taking an awful lot of notes throughout the course, therefore this repository is not particularly useful, nor reflective of the breadth of my knowledge.  
  Nevertheless, in the interests of posterity, you're welcome to have a look around.  
  As noted below, as I transition to University, I will create a new repository in the [tomatport](https://github.com/tomatport) organisation.

Repository for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) Notes.
For interwiki links to work properly, these notes need to viewed in a platform that supports them--GitHub's markdown renderer does not parse them.

Includes content relating to [[zk/BTEC Nationals Information Technology (2010)]] Extended Diploma and anything associated. 

Notes about Solihull-specific things like Assignments/Tasks/Dates/etc should be kept to Notion.

Will be archived and content migrated to a new GitHub organisation when I end up at Uni.

## Folders:
- **attachments**: Images and etc for most everything. Should (hopefully) be correctly sourced in the file that references them
- **daily**: Testing out daily notes
- **templates**: Note templates
- **zk**: Zettelkasten - contains the notes. Each are small bite-size summaries on topics, all intertwined and linked together. See [[zk/Conceptual]].
