# Notes

Repository for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) Notes.
For interwiki links to work properly, these notes need to viewed in a platform that supports them--GitHub's markdown renderer does not parse them.

Includes content relating to [[BTEC Nationals Information Technology (2010)]] Extended Diploma and anything associated. 
Notes about Solihull-specific things like Assignments/Tasks/Dates/etc should be kept to Notion.

Will be archived and content migrated to a new GitHub organisation when I end up at Uni.

Trying to be [[Conceptual]].
