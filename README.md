# Notes

Repository for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) Notes.
For interwiki links to work properly, these notes need to viewed in a platform that supports them--GitHub's markdown renderer does not parse them.

Includes content relating to [[zk/BTEC Nationals Information Technology (2010)]] Extended Diploma and anything associated. 
Notes about Solihull-specific things like Assignments/Tasks/Dates/etc should be kept to Notion.

Will be archived and content migrated to a new GitHub organisation when I end up at Uni.

## Folders:
- **attachments**: Images and etc for most everything. Should (hopefully) be correctly sourced in the file that references them
- **daily**: Testing out daily notes
- **templates**: Note templates
- **zk**: Zettelkasten - contains the notes. Each are small bite-size summaries on topics, all intertwined and linked together. See [[zk/Conceptual]].
