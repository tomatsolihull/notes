# Physical v Logical
The **physical topology** of a network is how the devices—such as end devices and network devices—are physically placed and connected in the real world. This includes lengths and types of cabling ([[fibre]], [[copper]], etc) and where devices are located (on a desk, mobile, in a rack, etc).  
It does not refer to specific protocols used to communicate or detailed information about the devices.

A **logical topology** defines how data actually flows through a network, making use of the physical topology. The logical topology includes details such as which protocols are used to communicate between devices.
