Random Access Memory is where a computer stores data that is currently processing or is likely to need soon. RAM is volatile, which means when power is lost its contents do not remain.  
Contains DRAM chips (dynamic RAM) which have a higher latency than SRAM chips found in CPUs, though they are significantly less expensive since they require continual refreshing. Sizes per stick (module) is between 2 and 512GB. DRAM chip brands include Micron and Samsung.
