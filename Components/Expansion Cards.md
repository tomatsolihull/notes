Interfaces: PCI, PCIe, AGP (Legacy)

# GPUs
The graphics processing unit (GPU) creates and outputs a video signal. Commonly, one is built into the CPU; this is called ‘integrated’ graphics. For more graphical horsepower—for running games or 3D modelling, for example—a ‘dedicated’ separate GPU may be desired. GPUs may have their own dedicated bank of memory. Can provide more [[Ports and Connectors/Display Ports]] for connecting multiple [[Monitor]]s.

# NIC  
Network Interface Cards add or improve the networking capabilities of a computer.

# Sound Cards  
Sound Cards add or improve the sound output capabilities of a computer or facilitate more [[Ports and Connectors/Sound Output]].
Not so common nowadays, since most motherboards have audio output built in.
