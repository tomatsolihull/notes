The motherboard (alternatively, ‘mainboard’) is the large circuit board that most everything interfaces with. It contains the socket for the CPU and varying slots and connections for other components.  
Motherboards come in varying sizes (‘form factors’) and have varying capabilities. The most important consideration is which CPUs are supported. Motherboards are available from brands such as ASUS, Gigabyte, ASRock and MSI.

# Data Connectors
Desktop motherboards often include a large selection of useful ports, whereas [[Servers]] will include the bare minimum.

- [[Ports and Connectors/USB]]
- [[Ports and Connectors/Display Ports]]
- [[Ports and Connectors/Sound Output]]

# Power
Provided by a [[Components/Power Supply]]
## 24-pin Mobo/Aux Power (in)
Provides 12V power to the motherboard and some components connected to it
## 8/4-pin CPU (in)
Provides power for the CPU
## PWM Power (output)
Controllable, variable voltage connector used for fans

# Expansion / IO
## M.2
Connection for ‘gum stick’ sized expansion devices (mainly [[Components/Solid State Drive]]); uses varying protocols (PCIe, NVMe or SATA)
## SATA
Serial ATA is for storage devices. Version 1 (150) supports speeds of up to 1.5GB/s, Version 2 (300) supports speeds of up to 3Gb/s and Version 3 (600) supports speeds of up to 6Gb/s.
## IDE/PATA
Parallel ATA is used for legacy storage devices. Maximum speeds are around 133MB/s which is significantly slower than SATA.
## Expansion Slots
For connecting [[Components/Expansion Cards]]
