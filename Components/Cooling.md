Many components – particularly the CPU and GPU – produce a large amount of heat when under load. All cooling solutions place a metal heatsink on top of the chip, with a layer of thermal paste to aid heat transfer. Air cooling makes use of a fan directly on the heatsink to dissipate heat. Water-cooling employs a radiator that works in a similar way to that of a car, with a pump moving water around. Cooing systems are available from companies such as Noctua, EVGA and Corsair.
